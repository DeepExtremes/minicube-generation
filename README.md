# DeepExtremes Auxiliary Era5 Cube Generation

Contains the instructions on how to create auxiliary Era5-Cubes for the 
DeepExtremes project.

Era5 data could be accessed directly from the DCS store, however, this would
significantly slow down the minicube generation, so this folder contains a 
means to create auxiliary cubes that hold the Era5 data in a daily
temporal resolution. The cubes are separated by variable (t2m, pev, slhf, ssr,
sp, sshf, e, tp) and spatial regions of 10*10 degrees. 

One auxiliary cube is generated by running `generate-era5-cube.py`. 
The script expects minimum longitude, maximum longitude, minimum latitude, 
maximum longitude, the long name of the Era5 variable and its short name, 
so run it like, e.g., 
`generate-era5-cube.py 20 30 50 60 2m_temperature t2m`.
Make sure not to overwrite existing cubes and to use only multiples 
of 10 when specifying the coordinates. The cubes are written to 
`s3://deepextremes/era5land` on AWS where they are found and 
used during the cube generation.

It will be more convenient to use `generate-era5-cubes.py`, which takes 
minimum longitude, maximum longitude, minimum latitude, and maximum longitude 
as input. This script will take care of that cubes for all variables are 
created and will run cube generations in parallel.
Again, make sure not to overwrite existing cubes and to use only multiples 
of 10 when specifying the coordinates.
